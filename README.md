# Security Operation Center (SOC) Using ELK stack

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Security Operation Center (SOC) for a small enterprise virtual network. The SOC utilizes the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), along with various networking and security tools such as GNS3, VMware, Cisco IOS, and Forti OS.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a robust SOC capable of detecting and mitigating cyber threats within a virtual network environment. The SOC is designed to handle real-world scenarios and ensure the security of critical resources.

## Tools Used

- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- GNS3
- VMware
- Cisco IOS
- Forti OS

## Use Cases

### 1. DOS Attack Mitigation

- Conducted a simulated Denial of Service (DOS) attack on a host within the virtual network.
- Utilized Fortigate firewall to detect and prevent the DOS attack in real-time, ensuring minimal disruption and safeguarding critical resources.

### 2. Malware Attack Detection and Prevention

- Executed a controlled malware attack on a target system within the virtual network.
- Implemented ELK SIEM for real-time monitoring and detected the malware promptly.
- Successfully prevented the spread of the malware using advanced endpoint detection and response techniques, mitigating potential damage.

### 3. Directory Traversal Attack Detection

- Simulated a directory traversal attack targeting an Apache webserver within the virtual environment.
- Configured ELK SIEM to capture and analyze suspicious activities, effectively identifying and thwarting the attack, thereby protecting sensitive data.
